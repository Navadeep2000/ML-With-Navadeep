# Stock Price Prediction ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¹

Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction repository!

## Labels, Feature and Target Variables

In this project, we're working with three main components:

- **Labels**: Labels represent the historical stock prices we want to forecast. These are the data points we're trying to predict. They serve as a reference point for the model to learn from and understand patterns.

- **Feature Variables**: These are the attributes and characteristics of historical stock data that serve as inputs to our prediction model. They include factors like trading volume, historical prices, and economic indicators. The model uses these features to make predictions about future stock prices.

- **Target Variables**: These are the future or target prices we aim to predict. The model uses the patterns and relationships it discovers in the feature variables to estimate these target prices.

## Linear Regression in Simple Terms

Linear Regression is like drawing a straight line through data points on a graph to make predictions. In this case, it helps us find a line that best fits the historical stock prices so we can predict future prices. It's as if we're connecting the dots and then extending the line into the future to estimate where the next dot might be.

**Remember**: This is just one method among many in the field of Machine Learning used to predict stock prices. By using Linear Regression, we're making a simplifying assumption that the relationship between historical and future stock prices can be approximated by a straight line. While it's straightforward, the real world can be more complex, and other methods may be needed for more accurate predictions.

Happy forecasting! ðŸš€
